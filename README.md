## Chess in Java

This is the chess project I made to practice Java and JavaFX. 


Implemented features:
- Only legal moves allowed
- Auto aligning pieces
- Capturing pieces
- Indicator when in check
- Indicator when in check mate
- Castling
- En Passant
- Restarting (slightly bugged)
- Promotion when a pawn reaches the end (auto-queen is enabled)
